# omeraydin.dev

This is my personal static website, using [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Hono](https://hono.dev). It's a work in progress.

To run locally:
```shell
bun install
bun run dev
```

To build the website:
```shell
bun run build
```

To deploy with wrangler (WIP):
```shell
bun run deploy
```
